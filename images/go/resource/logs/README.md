## Folder: `logs`
The `logs` folder contains log files generated by the application. These logs are crucial for monitoring, debugging, and auditing the application's behavior.

### Example Contents:
- `access.<date>.log`: Access logs for specific dates.
- `access.log`: A symbolic link pointing to the most recent log file.

### Notes:
- Ensure logs are rotated regularly to avoid excessive storage usage.
- Use proper permissions to secure sensitive information in log files.
