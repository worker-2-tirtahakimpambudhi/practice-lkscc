# Backend Kubernetes Manifests

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the backend of a Go-based application. The backend is designed to handle core business logic and API services.

## Structure
- **Deployment**: Defines the backend deployment configuration, including replicas, container image, and resource limits.
- **Service**: Exposes the backend deployment within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **ConfigMap**: Stores configuration data for the backend application.
- **Secret**: Manages sensitive information such as database credentials or API keys.
- **Ingress**: Configures external access to the backend service.

## Usage
1. Update the manifests with your specific configuration (e.g., image name, environment variables).
2. Apply the manifests using `kubectl apply -f <manifest-file>.yaml`.
3. Verify the deployment with `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.

Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is properly configured before deploying these manifests.
