## Folder: `coverage`
The `coverage` folder contains files and reports generated during test coverage analysis. These reports are used to understand how much of the codebase is exercised by tests.

### Example Contents:
- `coverage.out`: The raw coverage output file generated by tools like `go test`.

### Notes:
- Review coverage reports regularly to ensure sufficient test coverage.
- Consider integrating coverage analysis into CI/CD pipelines.
