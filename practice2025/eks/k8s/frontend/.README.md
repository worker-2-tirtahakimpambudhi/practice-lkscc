# Frontend Kubernetes Manifests

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the frontend of a Node.js application. The frontend is a critical component of the application, responsible for handling user interactions and communicating with backend services.

## Contents
- **Deployment YAML**: Defines the deployment configuration for the frontend application, including replicas, container image, and resource limits.
- **Service YAML**: Exposes the frontend application to other services or external traffic.
- **Ingress YAML** (if applicable): Configures routing rules for external access to the frontend.

## Usage
1. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is running and `kubectl` is configured.
2. Apply the manifests in this directory using:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f .
    ```
3. Verify the deployment and service are running:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get services
    ```

## Notes
- Update the container image in the deployment manifest to match your Node.js frontend build.
- Customize resource limits and environment variables as needed for your application.

This setup ensures a scalable and reliable deployment of the frontend in a Kubernetes environment.
